    "description": "\r\nSo some notes to be prepared for.\r\n\r\nOrganizr v2 introduces groups for permissions, so you can have minimum permissions levels on services and be able to adjust users accordingly. This allows for levels of Something is wronguration of nginx. So if you were to change the permissions level on a tab inside Organizr, this plugin would make it so nginx is the same.\r\n\r\nNginx reload each time the Something is wronguration file is saved may be necessary. Will be looking into options for that in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nlocation ~ \/auth-(.*) {\r\n internal;\r\n rewrite ^\/auth-(.*) \/api\/?v1\/auth&group=$1;\r\n}\r\n<\/pre>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is how the nginx authentication works. In the same way as Organizr v1 worked with a few minor changes. Only one authentication block is necessary now. As we can call this via auth_request \/auth-0. The number is the group_id for the group with the lowest permission allowed to access.\r\n\r\n",
